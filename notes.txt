--index.html-- 
we use main.jsx as our main file in the  script tag 
one div with an id of "root" where our injected htmls will render 

-- main.jsx--
 the only thing that this file is doing is hooking up our index.html to the react code

 The next idea to understand is our idea of componets
 
if we look  at our App.jsx
IF a function that start with a capital letter inside of react is called a componet. If You are returning jsx form a function its componet 

in order to be able to modify variables and have thing be interactive 
You need to use states. This is a hook inside of react useState()
it inports it form:
import { useState } from "react";
